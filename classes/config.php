				The define() function defines a constant.
		
		Constants are much like variables, except for the following differences:
		
		A constant's value cannot be changed after it is set
		Constant names do not need a leading dollar sign ($)
		Constants can be accessed regardless of scope
		Constant values can only be strings and numbers
